# Spectral-Mapping-Using-Prior-Re-Estimation-of-i-Vectors-and-System-Fusion-for-Voice-Conversion

In this work, we propose a new voice conversion (VC) method using i-vectors which consider low-dimensional representation of speech utterances. 
An attempt is made to restrict the i-vector variability in the intermediate computation of total variability (T) matrix by using a novel approach 
that uses modified-prior distribution of the intermediate i-vectors. This T-modification improves the speaker individuality conversion. 
For further improvement of conversion score and to keep a better balance between similarity and quality, band-wise spectrogram fusion between conventional 
oint density Gaussian mixture model (JDGMM) and i-vector based converted spectrograms is employed. The fused spectrogram retains more spectral details 
and leverages the complementary merits of each subsystem.
